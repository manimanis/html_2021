Instructions

<!-- liste ordonnée -->
    In the mixing bowl, thoroughly mix 1/2 C water, 1/2 C glue, and a few drops of food coloring.
    Add 1/2 tsp baking soda and mix completely.
    Add 2 tbsp contact lens solution and stir vigorously until the mixture starts pulling away from the edges of the bowl.
    Use your hands to knead the slime for 5–10 minutes until its texture stops changing. Do not worry if the slime is very runny and sticks to your hands at first. It will get easier to peel the slime off your hands as it gets thicker.
    Have fun playing with your slime!
