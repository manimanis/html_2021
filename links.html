  <h2 id="section-1">Types of links</h2>

  <h3 id="section-1-1">Inline links</h3>

  <p>An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be
    accessed with or without the user selecting the link.</p>

  <p>An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low
    resolution preview, cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is then usually available
    on demand, as is the case with print publishing software – e.g., with an external link. This allows for smaller file
    sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a
    page layout. </p>

  <h3 id="section-1-2">Anchor</h3>

  <p>An anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document[3] – generally text, though not necessarily. For
    instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image.
    One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a political map of
    Africa may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area
    interface allows for swapping skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in
    the various skin elements.</p>

  <h3 id="section-1-3">Fat link</h3>

  <p>A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"[4] or a "multi-tailed link"[5]) is a hyperlink
    which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a multivalued function.</p>

  <p><a href="#main">Top page</a></p>

  <h2 id="section-2">Uses in various technologies</h2>

  <h3 id="section-2-1">HTML</h3>

  <p>Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the
    Internet. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are written in the
    hypertext mark-up language HTML.</p>

  <p>This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the W3C organization could look like in HTML code:</p>

  <p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot;&gt;W3C organization website&lt;/a&gt;</p>

  <p>This HTML code consists of several tags:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag &lt;a, and includes a hyperlink reference
      href="https://www.w3.org/" to the URL for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)</li>
    <li>The URL is followed by &gt;, marking the end of the anchor opening tag.</li>
    <li>The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily
      visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display
      the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.</li>
    <li>Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and
      purple for a link already visited).</li>
    <li>The anchor closing tag (&lt;/a&gt;) terminates the hyperlink code.</li>
    <li>The &lt;a&gt; tag can also consist of various attributes such as the "rel" attribute which specifies the
      relationship between the current document and linked document.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Webgraph is a graph, formed from web pages as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.</p>

  <h3 id="section-2-2">XLink: hyperlinks</h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org">W3C</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C#Recommendations_and_Certifications">Recommendation</a> called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than
    those offered in HTML. These extended links can be multidirectional, linking from, within, and between XML
    documents. It can also describe simple links, which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality
    than hyperlinks in HTML.</p>
